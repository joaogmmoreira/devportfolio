# My Development Portfolio

This portfolio is a simple React application that showcases my work as a software developer. It's structured into several components, including a description of myself and a list of projects I've worked on. The application also supports two languages, Portuguese and English which can be toggled through a `languageState` prop.

This portfolio is always under improvement. As I continue to learn and grow as a developer, I will be updating this portfolio with new projects and experiences.

Feel free to explore and reach out if you have any questions or comments!
