        <p>
          My name is Jo√£o Gabriel. I was born in Rio de Janeiro and I&apos;ve live my whole life around here.
          I&apos;m Samuel&apos;s proud father. He is the love of my life.

          I studied biomedicine on college, having worked mostly in biochemistry laboratories. 
          But I fell in love with scientific divulgation later on my scientific carreer.
        </p>
        <p>
          In scientific divulgation I discovered the real meaning of changing the world. 
          &quot;When we change, the world changes with us&quot; - Gabriel, o Pensador.

          After college I went to work with my dad in the family business, having done all kinds of jobs
          to make the company thrive.
          I&apos;ve worked as salesman in another company as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later I met Trybe, a development school. Then I realized my life could change and now I&apos;m here to show the world
          lots of things I&apos;ve learned. Hard and Soft Skills, in Trybe, in life.
