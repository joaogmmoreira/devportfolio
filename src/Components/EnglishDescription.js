        <p>
          My name is Jo√£o Gabriel. I was born in Rio de Janeiro and I've live my whole life around here.
          I'm Samuel's proud father. He is the love of my life.

          I studied biomedicine on college, having worked mostly in biochemistry laboratories. 
          But I fell in love with scientific divulgation later on my scientific carreer.

        <p>
          In scientific divulgation I discovered the real meaning of changing the world.

          After college I went to work with my dad in the family business, having done all kinds of jobs
          to make the company thrive.
          I've worked as salesman in another company as well.

          Later I met Trybe, a development school. Then I realized my life could change and now I'm here to show the world
          lots of things I've learned. Hard and Soft Skills, in Trybe, in life.
